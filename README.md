# Sudoku-PyGame
A Sudoku game build in python to get a real feel of solving it on system.

Implemented a backtracking algorithm to look out for possible solution for the game and created a simple but engaging GUI.

# GUI
Used Pygame to build the GUI which uses the backtracking algo at backend to verify if the submited answer is correct or not.

Added small features like background image and a buzzer sound with strike for every wrong answer and a timer to keep the players on their toes.
